// Problem Description:

// Our company wants to have the ability to show different features to different users (this is also sometimes called A/B testing). 
// There is already an existing backend system for this, it stores information about which features should be enabled for current user. 
// For the purposes of task at hand this backend system is abstracted away like this:

// returns the state of *all* features for current user
function fetchAllFeatures() {
  // in reality, this would have been a `fetch` call:
  // `fetch("/api/features/all")`
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    const sampleFeatures = {
      "extended-summary": true,
      "feedback-dialog": false
    };
    setTimeout(resolve, 100, sampleFeatures);
  });
}

// You are tasked with implementing a robust, production-ready utility function getFeatureState(featureName). 
// The entire application will make use of this function, and we intend this function to be used as a central place 
// for feature management in our codebase. Here are some examples of intended usages:


// src/feature-x/summary.js
getFeatureState("extended-summary")
  .then(function(isEnabled) {
    if (isEnabled) {
      showExtendedSummary();
    } else {
      showBriefSummary();
    }
  });
